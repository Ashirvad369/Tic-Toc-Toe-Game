# Tic-Toc-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in an empty square. The goal is to be the first to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or all squares are filled, resulting in a draw if no winner is found.
